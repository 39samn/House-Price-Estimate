# House-Price-Estimate

This program implements a machine-learning algorithm, which involves with file I/O, dynamic memory allocation, and correctly implementing an
moderately complex algorithm. Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly used to provide services, such as face recognition in photographs, spelling correction, automated translation, and predicting what YouTube videos you might want to watch next. This program specifically implements a “one shot” learning algorithm that uses historical data to predict
house prices based on particular attributes.
